# CCSDS Orbit Ephemeris Message (OEM)

---

The Orbit Ephemeris Message (OEM) provides high‑fidelity, time‑tagged Cartesian ephemerides (position/velocity, optional acceleration) for interpolation without prescribing propagation models. It supports pre‑flight planning, operations scheduling, orbit comparison, navigation, interference assessment, collision avoidance, and collaborative maneuver planning.

- Applicable across the spacecraft and launch vehicle lifecycle.
- Use OEM when you need a time series of states to interpolate within a bounded span at higher fidelity/precision than an OPM or OMM.
- Optional covariance matrices can accompany ephemeris segments.

## When to choose each ODM

- OPM (Orbit Parameter Message)
  - Single state at one epoch; optional maneuvers and simple perturbation parameters.
  - Requires propagation by the recipient.
- OMM (Orbit Mean‑Elements Message)
  - Mean elements for analytical/semi‑analytical propagators (e.g., SGP/SGP4/TLE).
- OEM (Orbit Ephemeris Message)
  - Tabular states for interpolation only (no propagation required to interpret).
  - Optional acceleration triplets; optional covariance time histories per segment.
- OCM (Orbit Comprehensive Message)
  - Aggregates and extends OPM/OMM/OEM content with flexible sections (perturbations, maneuvers, OD, etc.).

## OEM at a glance

- Format: KVN (Keyword = Value Notation) for header and metadata; fixed‑structure lines for ephemeris and covariance data sections. XML mapping is standardized in Section 8.
- Units in KVN ephemeris and covariance lines: implicit (km, km/s, km/s²; covariance units derived accordingly). No units text appears in KVN lines.
- Time systems: CREATION_DATE is always UTC; all other times are per TIME_SYSTEM within each metadata block (Section 7.5.11).
- Segments: One metadata block per ephemeris block; segments can repeat. TIME_SYSTEM must not change within an OEM.
