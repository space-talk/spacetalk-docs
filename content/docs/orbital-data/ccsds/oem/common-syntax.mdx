# Common syntax and formats

This page consolidates KVN syntax, numeric/time formats, units, and comment placement rules used by the OEM. Clauses refer to CCSDS 502.0‑B‑3.

## Lines, characters, and termination

- Allowed line types: header, metadata, data, comment, blank (7.3.1).
- Maximum line length: 254 ASCII characters and spaces for OPM/OMM/OEM (excluding line termination) (7.3.2).
- Allowed characters: printable ASCII and blanks only; no control characters except CR, LF, CR/LF, or LF/CR terminators (7.3.4, 7.3.7).
- First non‑blank line must be the version keyword (e.g., CCSDS_OEM_VERS) (7.3.6).

## KVN (Key = Value Notation)

- Format: KEYWORD = value
- Keyword constraints: uppercase A–Z, digits and underscores only; no blanks.
- Exactly one assignment per line.
- White space around the keyword, equals sign, and end‑of‑line is insignificant.
- Order of assignments is fixed per the relevant section tables (e.g., [Table 5‑2](header.md#fields) for the OEM header; 7.4.8).

Comments (7.8)

- Each comment line starts with COMMENT plus at least one space; the remainder of the line is free text (7.8.5).
- Placement for OEM (7.8.9):
  - Header: immediately after CCSDS_OEM_VERS.
  - Metadata: immediately after META_START.
  - Data: at the beginning of the ephemeris data section (before the first ephemeris line).
  - Covariance: after COVARIANCE_START (before the first covariance line).
- Comments must not appear inside the block of ephemeris lines nor within the block of covariance matrix lines (7.8.9).

## Numberic values

- Integers: optional sign; range −2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.
- Non‑integers may be fixed‑point or floating‑point:
  - Fixed‑point: at least one digit before and after the decimal point; up to 16 digits total.
  - Floating‑point: optional sign; mantissa with decimal point in the second character; E/e exponent with optional sign; up to 16 significant digits; magnitude approx. 4.94E−324 to 1.798E+308.
- No blanks within numeric values (7.5.8).
- Recommendation: warn or reject numbers with more than 16 significant digits (7.5.6–7.5.8).

## Time values

- Absolute time formats (Time Code A/B):
  - YYYY‑MM‑DDThh:mm:ss[.d…][Z]
  - YYYY‑DDDThh:mm:ss[.d…][Z]
- Leading zeros required. Leap second "ss=60" is permitted (7.5.10).
- Time system:
  - CREATION_DATE is always UTC (7.5.11).
  - All other epochs follow TIME_SYSTEM declared in metadata (7.5.11).

## Vector encoding and arrays

- Multipart numeric vectors (e.g., OEM covariance rows) are space‑delimited and appear on a single line.

## Units

- OEM ephemeris KVN lines: units are implicit and must not be displayed (7.7.2.1).
  - Position: km; velocity: km/s; acceleration: km/s² when present.
- OEM covariance KVN lines: units are implicit and must not be displayed (7.7.2.2).
  - Position–position: km²; position–velocity: km²/s; velocity–velocity: km²/s².
- XML may include units attributes per Section 8; this does not change KVN rules.

Regex validation (7.10, Annex F)

- The standard provides example regex patterns to validate time strings and numeric forms (Annex F.6).
- Use per‑field regex plus semantic checks (ordering, monotonicity) for robust ingest.

Error handling and edge cases

- Leap seconds must parse and be represented as specified (7.5.10).
- TEME: for OEM, use only if documented in an ICD; TEME is primarily used for OMM/TLE (see 4.2.4.9; for OEM, use with caution).
- SCLK time systems require an ICD describing correlation to UTC; for OEM this is usually avoided (Annex B, B3; Annex I).
