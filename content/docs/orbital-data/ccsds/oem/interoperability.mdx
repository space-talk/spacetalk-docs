# When to use OEM vs other ODMs

## OEM

Provides tabular Cartesian states (position/velocity with optional acceleration) for interpolation within a declared time span—no propagation required to interpret the file.
Best for operations that need high-fidelity predicts, precise pointing, interference assessment, collision avoidance, and multi-party exchange with unambiguous frames/times.
Use when: Multiple epochs needed; high precision; covariance included.

## OPM

Single state at one epoch plus optional maneuvers and simple perturbation context; receiver must propagate.
Use when: Snapshot state; short-term predict with propagation.

## OMM

Mean elements for analytical/semi-analytical propagators (e.g., SGP/SGP4). TEME is specifically permitted for TLE-based content in OMM; not generally suitable for OEM.
Use when: Legacy TLE compatibility; coarse ephemeris.

## OCM

Comprehensive, flexible container that can include states, maneuvers, perturbations, OD metrics, multiple frames, and covariance time histories.
Use when: Full mission context; higher-order states (e.g., attitude).

## NDM combined instantiation (8.12)

Multiple ODMs can be combined under a single `<ndm>` root in XML.
Each contained message (`<opm>`, `<omm>`, `<oem>`, `<ocm>`) retains its own `id="CCSDS_xxx_VERS"` and `version="3.0"` attributes.
Use cases

Packaging constellation-wide content.
Bundling "no-burn" and "with-burn" OEMs or pairing an OEM with one or more OPMs highlighting key epochs.
Sharing a full OEM ephemeris with an OCM that carries maneuver and perturbations specification.

KVN equivalent: Sequential ODMs in one file, separated by headers.

## Frames, time systems, and caveats

TIME_SYSTEM

CREATION_DATE is UTC; all other times per TIME_SYSTEM specified in each OEM metadata block, and TIME_SYSTEM is fixed within the file.

## Frames

Use standard inertial or body-fixed frames (e.g., EME2000, ICRF, ITRF20xx). Declare REF_FRAME_EPOCH when required.
TEME: the Blue Book restricts TEME usage to OMM/TLE. Avoid TEME in OEM unless exchange partners agree in an ICD.

## SCLK and mission-relative times

Blue Book supports SCLK as a time system in Annex B; however OEM implementations should prefer standard time scales.
If SCLK must be used, an ICD shall define the mapping to UTC (epoch, partitions, drift, SCLK_SEC_PER_SI_SEC). See Annex I for extensions.

## Interoperability tips

Keep TIME_SYSTEM consistent across the entire OEM.
Do not include units text in KVN ephemeris or covariance lines; consumers should assume km, km/s, km/s² (and derived covariance units).
For discontinuities (maneuvers, eclipse modeling changes), split ephemeris into separate segments to avoid cross-segment interpolation (5.2.4.6).
Provide INTERPOLATION and INTERPOLATION_DEGREE when recommending a particular reconstruction method; ensure sufficient nodes for the specified degree.
Covariances

Use lower-triangular 6×6 state (X,Y,Z,X_DOT,Y_DOT,Z_DOT); include EPOCH and optionally COV_REF_FRAME.
Ensure matrices are positive semidefinite and ordered by increasing EPOCH.

OEM state at single epoch → OPM; add perturbations for propagation.

SANA registries: Validate ORIGINATOR, CENTER_NAME, REF_FRAME against https://sanaregistry.org (Annex B).

## Extensions and ICDs (Annex I)

USER_DEFINED content is not part of OEM; if extra information is needed, prefer an OCM or use an ICD describing companion content.
If non-standard frames, time systems (e.g., SCLK), or specialized interpolation schemes are required, define them in an ICD and reference it in COMMENT lines.
Coordinate registries (SANA)

Organizations (ORIGINATOR), orbit centers, time systems, frames, orbital elements: use SANA registries to ensure shared vocabulary (Annex B).

ICD example: Define custom covariance for acceleration if needed (not in OEM 6x6).
