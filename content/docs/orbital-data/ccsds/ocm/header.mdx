# OCM Header

## Purpose and scope

The Header identifies the file, origin, and creation time. It is the first non-blank content in an OCM and precedes the Metadata block.

## Block keywords and order
The header consists of ordered KVN assignments. The allowed keywords and their fixed order are:

1) CCSDS_OCM_VERS (M)
2) COMMENT (O; one or more, immediately after version)
3) CLASSIFICATION (O)
4) CREATION_DATE (M)
5) ORIGINATOR (M)
6) MESSAGE_ID (O)

## Fields

| Field | Requirement | Type | Format/Enum | Units | Default | Description | Example | Notes |
|-------|-------------|------|-------------|-------|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| CCSDS_OCM_VERS | Mandatory | real (x.y) | version number | n/a | None | Version of the OCM format. Major x increments for major changes, minor y for corrections. Current Blue Book: 3.0. | 3.0 | Must be the first non-blank line. |
| COMMENT | Optional | text | KVN comment line | n/a | None | Free-text comment lines. Only permitted immediately after CCSDS_OCM_VERS in the header. | COMMENT This is a comment | See comment placement rules in /ocm/common-syntax |
| CLASSIFICATION | Optional | text | free-text | n/a | None | Message classification/caveats agreed between partners. | SBU - Operator-proprietary data; secondary distribution not permitted | Informative only. |
| CREATION_DATE | Mandatory | time | CCSDS A/B UTC; see /refs/enums-formats-units#time-formats | n/a | None | File creation date/time in UTC. | 2002-204T15:56:23Z | Must be UTC regardless of TIME_SYSTEM elsewhere. Leap seconds allowed. |
| ORIGINATOR | Mandatory | text | organization from SANA registry /refs/enums-formats-units#organizations | n/a | None | Creating agency/operator (abbreviation preferred). | GSFC | Use SANA Organizations; register if missing. |
| MESSAGE_ID | Optional | text | free-text | n/a | None | Unique identifier assigned by originator. | OCM_201113719185 | Uniqueness semantics are originator-defined. |

## Validation and constraints

- CCSDS_OCM_VERS must equal the schema/version understood by the parser; reject unknown major versions.
- COMMENT lines are allowed only immediately after the version line in the header.
- CREATION_DATE must validate against CCSDS Time Code A/B (UTC).
- ORIGINATOR value should be present in the SANA Organizations registry.

## Cross-references

- Subsequent sections shall conform to the version declared here.
- Additional comments can be placed at the start of other blocks (see /ocm/common-syntax).
