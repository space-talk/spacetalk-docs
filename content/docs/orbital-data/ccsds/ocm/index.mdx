# CCSDS Orbit Comprehensive Message (OCM)

---

The Orbit Comprehensive Message (OCM) is the most flexible member of the CCSDS Orbit Data Messages (ODM) family. It aggregates and extends OPM, OMM, and OEM capabilities in a single, compact message:
- Hybrid orbit content: single-epoch and time histories; Cartesian and/or orbital elements.
- Covariance content: time series; selectable dimension/order; multiple element-set bases.
- Maneuvers: impulsive and finite thrust, duty cycles (time- and angle-based), and deployment events with host/child mass and ΔV relationships.
- Space-object physical characteristics for drag/SRP and collision-probability use.
- Perturbations model specification and sources (EOP, celestial ephemerides, atmosphere, gravity, shadowing, space weather).
- Orbit-determination (OD) settings and quality metrics.

OCM supports parent/child deployments within one message and is suitable for automated, high-volume exchanges (e.g., constellations) while remaining concise.

Standard: CCSDS 502.0-B-3 (Apr 2023).

## Scope and lifecycle applicability

OCM is applicable to all phases: pre‑flight design, LEOP, routine operations, maintenance, disposal, and launch/mission segments. It enables:
- pre-flight planning and scheduling,
- operations predicts and antenna pointing,
- navigation, propagation, and reconstruction,
- electromagnetic and physical interference assessments,
- conjunction screening and collision-risk analysis,
- collaborative maneuver design and execution.

## When to choose OCM vs OPM/OMM/OEM

Select the message based on required content and consumer capabilities:

- Use OCM when you need one or more of:
  - multiple or hybrid trajectory representations (elements and/or Cartesian),
  - time histories for states and/or covariances,
  - maneuver time histories (including duty-cycles, low-thrust, or deployments),
  - perturbations and data-source disclosure for propagation/interpolation,
  - compact packaging of many optional data blocks in one file.

- Use OPM (single state with optional maneuvers) when:
  - a single-epoch Cartesian state (plus simple maneuvers) suffices,
  - the receiver will propagate with mutually agreed models.

- Use OMM (mean elements, TLE-like exchanges) when:
  - the receiver uses analytical/semi-analytical models (e.g., SGP4/XP),
  - you need an interoperable TLE-style exchange.

- Use OEM (high-fidelity tabular ephemeris) when:
  - you will provide position/velocity time series for interpolation,
  - you do not need to embed maneuver/perturbations modeling details.

Notes
- OCM can replace multiple OPM/OMM/OEM files for a single object.
- OCM supports parent/child deployments; multi-object exchanges otherwise require multiple files or an XML NDM combined instantiation.

## Key advantages of OCM

- Hybrid content in one file; minimal mandatory fields for compactness.
- Explicit time-system handling and a reference epoch (EPOCH_TZERO) for relative times.
- Rich linking to related messages (ADM, CDM, PRM, RDM, TDM).
- Standardized enumerations and frames via SANA registries.
- XML representation available; KVN remains the primary non-XML format.

## Interoperability expectations

- Use only ASCII; adhere to KVN key ordering and block ordering.
- Use SANA-registered values where required (time systems, centers, frames, element sets, covariance types).
- Keep time tags within a block either all absolute or all relative (no mixing).
- Ensure covariance positive semi-definiteness and correct element ordering.
- Avoid TEME in OCM except where explicitly permitted by the standard (TEME is reserved for OMM/TLE contexts).
