# Interoperability notes and crosswalks

## OCM vs. OPM/OMM/OEM

- OPM: single Cartesian state (optionally with simple maneuvers). OCM can represent the same as a single CARTP(V) trajectory line and a MAN block.
- OMM: mean elements (TLE-style). OCM can carry mean elements via a trajectory block with TRAJ_TYPE set to the appropriate mean‑element set and ORB_AVERAGING specified. Do not use TEME in OCM; keep TLE/TEME exchanges in OMM.
- OEM: tabular ephemerides for interpolation. OCM trajectory blocks can substitute OEM for ephemeris delivery and also embed maneuvers, covariances, and model disclosures.

## Linking related messages

- Use PREVIOUS_MESSAGE_ID/NEXT_MESSAGE_ID (and epochs) to chain OCMs by originator/object.
- Cross-message links:
  - ADM_MSG_LINK for attitude,
  - CDM_MSG_LINK for conjunctions,
  - PRM_MSG_LINK for pointing requests,
  - RDM_MSG_LINK for reentry,
  - TDM_MSG_LINK for observations underpinning OD.

## Parent/child deployments

- Use a MAN block with MAN_DEVICE_ID = DEPLOY and the deployment composition to:
  - assign child IDs (DEPLOY_ID),
  - specify child ΔV in MAN_REF_FRAME,
  - decrement host mass (DEPLOY_MASS ≤ 0),
  - specify DEPLOY_DV_RATIO (host response; typically ≤ 0).
- Represent the children's subsequent trajectories in their own OCMs (or in a higher-level product), referencing the deployment time and child IDs.

## Combined NDM bundling

- Use the `<ndm>` root (NDM/XML) to package multiple ODMs (OPM/OMM/OEM/OCM) together, e.g., multi-object predicts or "with‑burn/no‑burn" alternatives.
- Keep each message's header/body self-contained; the NDM's only required attributes on child messages are `id` and `version`.

## Enumerations and registries

- Prefer SANA registries for organizations, centers, frames, element sets, and covariance types.
- Register new values through the SANA process when needed; until registered, values may be used by mutual agreement but should be documented in an ICD.

## Common pitfalls and remedies

- TEME usage: restrict to OMM (TLE workflows). For OCM, use ICRF/ICRF3, EME2000/J2000, or appropriate orbit-relative/earth-fixed frames.
- Mixed absolute/relative times in a block: disallow; split into separate blocks.
- Incomplete duty-cycle definitions: ensure required DC_* keys are present based on DC_TYPE.
- Covariance PSD: verify and, if necessary, regularize before publication.
- Units inline: avoid on multipartite lines; use *_UNITS fields or XML attributes on scalars.
